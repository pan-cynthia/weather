# Weather

This is a weather web application created using React, Tailwind CSS, and the Open-Meteo API. For any searched city, it provides the current temperature, an hourly and daily forecast, and the current weather conditions. The default temperature unit is set to Fahrenheit, but it can be toggled to Celsius. The app is deployed on Github and can be accessed [here](https://pan-cynthia.github.io/weather/).
